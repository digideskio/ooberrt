## Objective Open ASN.1 BER Run-time (ooberrt)

The Objective Open BER Run-time is an open source C BER/DER run-time 
library that may be used with source code generated from the 
Objective Systems ASN1C compiler.  The library does not provide full 
support for the X.680 standard, but provides support for the most 
common items used in many ASN.1 specifications.  These include security 
specifications such as PKIX, CMS and PKCS; a number of telephony call 
detail record (CDR) formats such as TAP3, NRTRDE, and various vendor 
switch specifcations; and other simple specifications that make use 
of the BER/DER encoding rules. 

Particular ASN.1 types known to not be supported in this library include 
REAL, EXTERNAL, EMBEDDED-PDV, Restricted Character String, and the 
newer date/time and IRI types.  In addition, the libary is known to 
be not as performant as our standard, commercial BER/DER/CER library. 
Nonetheless, it should prove to be adequate for a variety of applications.

### Building on Windows using Visual Studio

To build the library for Windows, unzip the package and cd to the build
subdirectory.  Execute the 'nmake' command to run the Visual Studio nmake 
utility to build the package. Visual Studio C/C++ compilation flags are 
located in the platform.mk file in the root directory.

### Building on Linux

To build the package on Linux or UNIX, rename or delete the platform.mk 
file in the main directory and then rename the platform.gnu file to 
platform.mk:

```
rm -f platform.mk
mv platform.gnu platform.mk
```

Then cd to the build subdirectory and execute make.

Note that source files in the package are stored in Windows (DOS) format. 
It make be necessary to convert to UNIX format on some systems. 
A utility program such as dos2unix can be used to convert the files 
to UNIX format if necessary (Google dos2unix for details).

### Using the compiled library

To use the library, it should be copied into a subdirectory under the 
main ASN1C installation root directory.  Sample programs can be modified 
to use the library by editing the associated makefile and changing the 
path to the library file to reference the ooberrt_a.lib file (Windows) 
or libooberrt.a file (Unix, Linux, or Mac OSX).

### License

The LICENSE file within this package contains information on the 
open source license.  This license allows open source redistribution 
of the source and binary files in the library; however, it does not 
grant permission to redistribute applications containing code generated 
with the ASN1C compiler.  For that, a license to the ASN1C SDK (any 
configuration) is required.
