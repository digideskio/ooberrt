 * BER/DER C encode functions handle the BER encoding of the primitive ASN.1
 * data types and ASN.1 length and tag fields within a message. Calls to these
 * functions are assembled in the C source code generated by the ASN1C complier
 * to accomplish the encoding of complex ASN.1 structures. These functions are
 * also directly callable from within a user's application program if the need
 * to accomplish a low level encoding function exists.
 *
 * The procedure to call the encode function that encodes a primitive type is
 * the same as the procedure to call a compiler generated encode function
 * described above. The rtInitContext and xe_setp functions must first be
 * called to initialize a context variable and set a pointer to the buffer into
 * which the variable is to be encoded. A static encode buffer is specified by
 * specifying a pointer to a buffer and buffer size. Setting the buffer address
 * to NULL and buffer size to 0 specifies a dynamic buffer. The primitive
 * encode function is invoked. Finally, xe_getp is called to retrieve a
 * pointer to the encoded message component.
